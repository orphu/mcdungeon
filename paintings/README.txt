This folder contains the data for custom paintings. Whenever MCDungeon
creates a custom painting as loot, a random painting will be selected from
this folder. If there are no files, a blank map will be substituted.

You can add them to your loot tables with the special item "Custom Painting"

The default paintings provided are public domain works sourced from
Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/) There are also two custom made guides,
one for brewing and one for building circles.

You may add your own paintings using the following guide:

    * Paintings consist of two files: A "txt" file containg the painting's
      title and lore text; and a "dat" file containing the actual image.

    * In the txt file, the first line is the title and then one line per
      line of lore text.
      
    * The dat file contains the map data in minecraft's format. You can
      convert images to, or create your own maps using a tool like
      ImageToMap. (http://github.com/lasarus/ImageToMap-X)
      You can also copy dat files directly from the data folder in a
      minecraft world.
